## üéØ CURRENT PRIORITY: Phase 15 - Intelligent Chunking System for Rule Extraction Accuracy

**Status**: **CRITICAL ACCURACY ISSUE IDENTIFIED** üö® - BusinessRuleExtractionAgent missing 41.7% of rules
**Priority**: **HIGH** - Core functionality accuracy affects user confidence
**Overall Assessment**: A- (Very Good) - Security and performance optimized, now addressing extraction completeness

### üî¥ **Critical Accuracy Issue Discovered:**
**BusinessRuleExtractionAgent Rule Extraction Gap**: COBOL analysis revealed only 58.3% rule extraction completeness (14/24 rules). Current naive line-based chunking breaks business rule contexts across chunk boundaries, resulting in incomplete rule extraction that undermines user confidence in system accuracy.

## Phase 15: Intelligent Chunking System Implementation - üö® HIGH PRIORITY

### **Objective**: 
Implement comprehensive intelligent chunking solution to achieve 90%+ rule extraction accuracy across all legacy file types (COBOL, Java, Pascal, etc.)

### **Key Components (3-day timeline):**

#### **üìã Phase 15A: Language Detection & Profile System (Day 1)**
- [x] Create `config/language_profiles.yaml` with configurable language profiles (COBOL, Java, Pascal)
- [x] Implement `LanguageDetector` class for auto-detection with 95%+ accuracy
- [x] Add language-specific chunking parameters (¬±50% size flexibility)
- [x] Integrate language detection into BusinessRuleExtractionAgent
- [x] Test language detection accuracy with existing samples

#### **üìã Phase 15B: Intelligent Chunking Engine (Day 2)**
- [x] Implement `IntelligentChunker` with section-aware chunking strategy
- [x] Add rule boundary detection to prevent splitting mid-rule
- [x] Replace fixed line-based chunking with adaptive algorithms
- [x] Add fallback strategy chain (section-aware ‚Üí rule-boundary ‚Üí smart-overlap ‚Üí fixed)
- [x] Test chunking effectiveness on COBOL sample (target: 85%+ rule extraction)

#### **üìã Phase 15C: Validation & Real-Time Feedback (Day 2-3)**
- [x] Implement `RuleCompletenessAnalyzer` for extraction validation
- [x] Add real-time progress indicators: "Found 18 of ~24 expected rules"
- [x] Add 90% completeness threshold warnings
- [x] Enhance user feedback with extraction quality metrics
- [x] Add graceful failure handling when chunking strategies fail

#### **üìã Phase 15D: Testing & Production Readiness (Day 3)**
- [x] Comprehensive testing with multiple legacy file types
- [x] Performance optimization and validation
- [x] Documentation and integration guides
- [x] Production deployment preparation

### **Success Metrics:**
- **COBOL Rule Extraction**: Improve from 58.3% (14/24) to 90%+ (22+/24) rules extracted
- **Language Detection**: 95%+ accuracy on common legacy languages
- **Processing Performance**: <2x current processing time (acceptable for accuracy gains)
- **User Feedback**: Clear completeness indicators and extraction quality metrics

### **Business Value:**
- **User Confidence**: Transparent extraction completeness prevents false confidence in partial results
- **Accuracy First**: 90%+ extraction threshold ensures reliable business decision support
- **Universal Solution**: Works across all legacy languages, not just COBOL
- **Extensibility**: Easy addition of new language profiles for client-specific needs
