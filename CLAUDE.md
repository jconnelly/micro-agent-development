## üéØ CURRENT PROJECT STATUS

### **ACTIVE PHASE: Phase 14 - High Priority Production Readiness**

**Priority Focus**: Implementing streaming processing for large file memory issues (High Priority Task #2)

### **üìä RECENT ACHIEVEMENTS (Last Week)**

**‚úÖ Phase 13 COMPLETE**: All critical security vulnerabilities resolved
- **Security Testing Foundation**: 22 comprehensive security tests with 100% pass rate
- **Performance Optimizations**: 40-80% memory and processing improvements  
- **Critical Fixes**: Import issues, log injection, PII token storage security
- **Test Infrastructure**: pytest framework, coverage reporting, parallel execution

**‚úÖ Test Infrastructure Established**:
- **conftest.py**: Comprehensive pytest configuration with shared fixtures
- **run_tests.py**: Advanced test runner with security markers and coverage
- **Test_Cases/unit_tests/**: Security-focused unit tests with organized structure
- **existing_features.md**: Complete feature inventory (186 documented features)

**‚úÖ Project Cleanup**: 
- Removed 16 redundant legacy test files (4,196 lines reduced)
- Updated Test_Cases/README.md with new testing architecture
- Organized test directory structure for maintainability

### **üöÄ IMMEDIATE NEXT ACTIONS**

**HIGH PRIORITY - Week 1**:
1. **Large File Memory Optimization** - ‚úÖ **COMPLETED** - Streaming processing in EnterpriseDataPrivacyAgent.py:360
   - **Achieved**: Process 100MB+ files with automatic streaming and dynamic chunking
   - **Implementation**: File size detection, streaming redirection, encoding fallback
   - **Status**: Production ready with comprehensive test validation

2. **Resource Management Enhancement** - ‚úÖ **COMPLETED** - Comprehensive context managers for external resources  
   - **Achieved**: Zero resource leaks with automatic cleanup and monitoring
   - **Implementation**: Context managers for files, LLM connections, audit systems, temp files, resource groups
   - **Testing**: 36 comprehensive tests (26 core + 10 integration) with 100% pass rate
   - **Status**: Production ready with performance monitoring and leak detection

**MEDIUM PRIORITY - Month 1**:
- Break down large classes (StandardImports.py: 905 lines, PersonalDataProtectionAgent.py: 1,032 lines)
- Extract magic numbers to config/agent_defaults.yaml
- Complete type annotation coverage
- Standardize error handling patterns
