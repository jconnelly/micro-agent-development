## What is BYO-LLM?

**"Bring Your Own LLM"** means you can use **your preferred AI provider** with our platform instead of being locked into a single vendor's model. Think of it like choosing your own cloud provider (AWS, Azure, Google) while still using the same enterprise software.

### 🔄 **The Traditional Problem**
Most AI platforms force you to use their specific LLM:
- **Vendor Lock-in**: Can't switch providers without changing platforms
- **Cost Control**: No negotiating power or pricing flexibility  
- **Compliance Issues**: May not meet your security/regulatory requirements
- **Performance Limitations**: Stuck with one model's capabilities

### ✅ **Our BYO-LLM Solution**
Choose from **8+ supported LLM providers** while keeping all platform functionality:
- **OpenAI**: GPT-4, GPT-3.5-turbo
- **Anthropic**: Claude 3 Opus, Claude 3.5 Sonnet
- **Google**: Gemini Pro, Gemini 2.0 Flash
- **Azure OpenAI**: Enterprise-grade GPT models
- **AWS Bedrock**: Claude, Titan, Jurassic models
- **Local/On-Premise**: Your own fine-tuned models
- **Custom APIs**: Any OpenAI-compatible endpoint

```

#### **Option 2: Multi-Provider (Different Models for Different Tasks)**
```yaml
llm_config:
  rule_extraction:
    provider: "anthropic"    # Best for complex analysis
    model: "claude-3-opus"
  
  pii_detection:
    provider: "openai"       # Fast and cost-effective
    model: "gpt-3.5-turbo"
  
  document_classification:
    provider: "google"       # Excellent classification
    model: "gemini-pro"
```

#### **Option 3: Enterprise On-Premise**
```yaml
llm_config:
  provider: "custom"
